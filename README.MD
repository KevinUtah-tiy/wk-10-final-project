## Synopsis

This project allows the user to see the weather and a map of various trails in the Wasatch Mountains.  These trails are found in Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon.

For this project, there are no package managers.


## Code Example

For the weather data, I used an API from OpenWeatherMap.org.
For the maps, I used an API from Google Maps and Leaflet.js.


## Motivation

I moved to Utah and had always wanted to snowshoe.  The sites I visited did not give all the information I wanted.  Each trail listed has the avalanche warning, weather data at the trailhead, and an interactive map of the trail.
