<h2>Red Pine Lake via White Pine Lake trailhead</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
The White Pine trailhead sits on the south side of the road 5.6 miles up Little
Cottonwood Canyon Road, past Tanner’s Campground. <br><br>After the road bends from traveling northeast to southeast, watch for a road closure gate on the south side of the road.  Directly after this gate (which should be standing 10+ ft in the air if the road is open), there is a right turn that is easy to miss.

<br>

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
The trail begins on the south side of the trailhead parking lot behind the restrooms.
Begin by crossing the bridge over Little Cottonwood Creek and following the trail approximately 1
mile to the “Y” where the trail to White Pine Lake takes a sharp
left and heads east, and the trails to
Red Pine and Maybird head west. A sign points the way, and because these trails are heavily used
in the winter, they will be easily distinguishable. Head west at the "Y" where the White Pine Lake Trail and Red Pine Lake Trail diverge.<br><br>Red Pine Lake is a gorgeous but rigorous climb up Red Pine
Canyon in a southerly direction. The trail passes peaceful mountain streams, and at the top you are
rewarded with views of some of the highest peaks in the range.  The Lake itself may be covered with snow, but it sits at the base of the steep chutes
and canyon walls at the top. It’s a beautiful area, but one to be tackled only when avalanche
conditions are stable.  <br><br>I have almost slid down the west-facing side of the mountain as the trail is very narrow.  It is beautifult, but be careful.

<h3>Distance:</h3>
About 8 miles roundtrip
<br>
<br>

<h3>Elevation Gain:</h3>
Elevation at trailhead:  7700 ft<br>
Elevation at White Pine Lake:  9700 ft<br>
Gain: 2000 ft
<br>
<br>

<h3>Trail Rating:</h3>
Difficult. <br><br>After passing through the White Pine Lake trail, it becomes difficult.  You must take care to navigate a water crossing and staying on the side of the steep mountain with a narrow trail.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Known Avalanche Locations:</h3>
High.  There is a high awareness for avalanches in this area and beacons are generally worn.  Personally, I would not attempt this trail unless avalanche conditions are stable.
