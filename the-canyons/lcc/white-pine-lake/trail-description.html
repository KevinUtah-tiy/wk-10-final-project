<h2>White Pine Lake via White Pine Lake trailhead</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
The White Pine trailhead sits on the south side of the road 5.6 miles up Little
Cottonwood Canyon Road, past Tanner’s Campground. <br><br>After the road bends from traveling northeast to southeast, watch for a road closure gate on the south side of the road.  Directly after this gate (which should be standing 10+ ft in the air if the road is open), there is a right turn that is easy to miss.

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
The trail begins on the south side of the trailhead parking lot behind the restrooms.
Begin by crossing the bridge over Little Cottonwood Creek and following the trail approximately 1
mile to the “Y” where the trail to White Pine Lake takes a sharp
left and heads east, and the trails to
Red Pine and Maybird head west. A sign points the way, and because these trails are heavily used
in the winter, they will be easily distinguishable. Head west at the "Y" where the White Pine Lake Trail and Red Pine Lake Trail diverge.<br><br>The trail to White Pine winds up the canyon to the east and then turning south
beneath many a steep slope, through evergreens, and toward the end of the trail
­­
over huge
granite boulders that may
be comp
letely covered in snow. If the trail becomes hard to pinpoint
after the ‘Y’ remember that you are heading south to nearly the top of White Pine.
The Lake itself
sits up and over a ridge near the top of the canyon. It does not become visible until you have
climbed right to it, and even then may not be visible due to the snow. Sitting at the
base of steep,
sheer granite cliffs and rock
 beds, it snuggles into the top of the canyon, but you can snowshoe right
to it. At times the view on the way up opens to the other side of Little Cottonwood Canyon with its
sheer cliffs and the colorful strata near the top of the walls. Enjoy the journey. White Baldy and
Pfeifferhorn sit above the Lake.
<br><br>Return on the same path.

<h3>Distance:</h3>
About 8 miles roundtrip
<br>
<br>

<h3>Elevation Gain:</h3>
Elevation at trailhead:  7700 ft<br>
Elevation at Doughnut Falls:  10137 ft<br>
Gain: 2437 ft (way up there!)
<br>
<br>

<h3>Trail Rating:</h3>
Difficult. <br><br>There are switch-backs, which indicates the mountain is steep.<br><br>  Toward the end of the climb, there is a pass that is narrow and steep.  Use extreme caution.  <br><br>We hiked this in late June and there was still snow to traverse.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Known Avalanche Locations:</h3>
High.  There is a high awareness for avalanches in this area and beacons are generally worn.  Personally, I would not attempt this trail unless avalanche conditions are stable.
