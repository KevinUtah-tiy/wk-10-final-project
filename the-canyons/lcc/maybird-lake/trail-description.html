<h2>Maybird Lake via White Pine Lake Trailhead
</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
The White Pine trailhead sits on the south side of the road 5.6 miles up Little
Cottonwood Canyon Road, past Tanner’s Campground. <br><br>After the road bends from traveling northeast to southeast, watch for a road closure gate on the south side of the road.  Directly after this gate (which should be standing 10+ ft in the air if the road is open), there is a right turn that is easy to miss.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
The trail begins on the south side of the trailhead parking lot behind the restrooms.
Begin by crossing the bridge over Little Cottonwood Creek and following the trail approximately 1
mile to the “Y” where the trail to White Pine Lake takes a sharp
left and heads east, and the trails to
Red Pine and Maybird head west. A sign points the way, and because these trails are heavily used
in the winter, they will be easily distinguishable. Head west at the "Y" where the White Pine Lake Trail and Red Pine Lake Trail diverge.<br><br>The trail to Maybird Lake follows the Red Pine Lake trail along the western side of the mountain in a southerly direction.<br><br>At 1.25 miles
up the trail, on a clear day, the view down Little Cottonwood Canyon opens up and you can see
down canyon, across the Salt Lake Valley, and to the Oquirrhs on the other side.  It’s a grand view.
You are also graced with vista of steep chutes down the north side of Little Cottonwood Canyon as
you traverse this section of the trail. The second leg of the trail concludes at 2.23 miles where an
easy-to-miss wooden bridge crosses Red Pine Creek.  Keep your eyes open for the bridge as it will
be covered in deep snow.  <br><br>The trail breaks here for the second time.  If you continue straight up the
trail you will find yourself in Red Pine Canyon, but to reach Maybird you will head to the right by
crossing over the bridge and heading in a westerly direction.  This is the Red Pine turnoff. The third
leg of the trail continues to the ridge for a total of approximately 2.75 miles. The ridge has no strong
distinguishing factors, other than you can look down to the west where Maybird Lakes reside, and
the views of the surrounding mountains are beautiful. Conclude the trail at a spot where you can
enjoy the view and have lunch.
<br><br>Return on the same path.
