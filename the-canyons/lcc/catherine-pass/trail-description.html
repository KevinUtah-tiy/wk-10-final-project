<h2>Albion Basin Road to Catherine Pass / Sunset Peak Trail</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
The Albion Basin is part of Alta Ski Resort. The resort resides at the top of Little
Cottonwood Canyon. Drive up East Little Cottonwood Canyon Road as far as you can go.  The trail starts at the winter gate.<br><br>
Park here and begin walking along the Albion Basin Road.  You will pass Albion and Sunnyside ski lifts as well as sharing the mountain with skiers.

<br>

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
At the winter gate, a snow-cat groomed road head
s east.  The Albion Basin Road (aka "summer road") takes you up to the ridge where you will drop into Albion Basin. A quarter mile up the
groomed “summer road” the cat track forks north straight up the mountain.  Head
up this track for a
more direct route to the Basin.  Mileag
e for this trip is figured going straight up this face, but you will
get to the same place by continuing to follow the track straight – it will just take longer. The resort
asks that snowshoers stay on the “summer road” to access the basin, and once in the basin, that
you stay off main ski runs. Near the top of the mountain, after about .9 of a mile, the summer road
crosses under a ski lift and the road breaks for the ski run.  The upper road says, “Uphill Traffic Only”.
This is the appropriate trail for snowshoers to follow.  This short route takes you to the top of the ridge
and the top of the Sunnyside lift. Cross the ski run and Albion Basin sits just over the south ridge
behind the lift.  From here you can trek into Albion Basin in the direction that best suits you.  Enjoy the
powdery down hills, stay out of skiers’ way, and head
back out the way you came when you’ve
had enough.<br><br>We have not made it past here towards Sunset Peak in the winter, so I will update this trail at a future time.
