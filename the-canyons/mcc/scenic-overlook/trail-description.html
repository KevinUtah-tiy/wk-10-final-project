<h2>Desolation Trail to Scenic Overlook</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
Desolation Trailhead sits 2.6 miles up Mill Creek Canyon from the fee station â€“
just past the Mill Creek Inn on the south side of the road.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
From the restroom facilities, take the trail west.  It makes a sharp turn to the south and increases in elevation quickly.  This elevation gain isn't very long (approximately .1 mile), just far enough to get a good warm up.  The trail heads west and makes 5 switch-backs to take the hiker south as you make it up the east side of the mountain.  Another switch-back will take you to the west side of the mountain.  You will make your way south, then east, then south again.  You will traverse five more switch-backs before reaching the trail exit to get to the scenic overlook.
<br><br>Return on the same path.
