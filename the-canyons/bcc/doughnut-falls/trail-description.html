<h2>Doughnut Falls </h2>

<hr>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
Drive east up Big Cottonwood Canyon for 9.1 miles
 to Mill D trailhead. Park on
the south side of the road.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
The route to Doughnut Falls is popular, well-used, and relatively easy to navigate. <br><br>
Cardiff road is gated off during the winter and passes through summer homes and Jordan
Pines Campground.  Follow this road south for .75 mile as it will take you to the Doughnut Falls trailhead. <br><br>
Doughnut Falls trailhead has a restroom (which may be closed), and a trail board that marks the
route. The trail begins to the west of the summer parking area between the vault toilet and trail
board. The trail begins from here by snaking through the forest for a half mile and then crossing a
stream on a small bridge. On the other side of the bridge a 4-wheel drive road intersects with the
trail. Doughnut Falls is .5 mile from this point.  Turn south on this road and follow it for a hundred yards
where it will then turn back into a trail that makes its way through the trees and near the stream that
runs down from Doughnut Falls.  Return following the same route.
