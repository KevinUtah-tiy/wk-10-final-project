<h2>Days Fork Trail from Spruces Campground</h2>

<hr>

Spruces Campground sits 9.7 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon. Park in the
Spruces parking lot off to the south side of the road.  The lot sits just past the railroad-crossing road
blocks. Park here.

<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
The trail takes off directly from the southwest corner of the Spruces parking lot. It
winds south around a group of trees, and passes a restroom which is open for winter use.  Shortly
after passing the restroom, you will pass a trail sign for Days Fork trail. Use these markers to make sure
you’re on the right path, as there are a couple paths that head out from Spruces parking lot. The
trail winds its way west and south after the sign as it climbs up Days Fork. At times the trail winds right
through the trees while at other times it breaks out of the trees into open sections. You can’t go
wrong as long as you make your way up the fork.  At 1.3 miles the trail passes beneath an
avalan
che shoot.  It is easy to tell where it has run before as the mountainside is bare of trees. The
trail passes at the bottom of the avalan
che run out, simply use caution. You will know you have
reached Lower Meadow by the steep slopes that come in on your right while the path opens into a
wider meadow area. Lower Meadows lies 1.6 miles from the trailhead.  Remember that going any
further will be dangerous during unstable avalan
che conditions. Return back down the fork to get to
your car.
