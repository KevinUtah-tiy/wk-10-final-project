<h3>Trail Description:</h3>
Park at Spruces Campground 9.7 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon on the south side of the road. The trail takes off from the southwest corner of the parking lot. It winds south around a group of trees, and passes a restroom which is open for winter use. Shortly after passing the restroom, you will pass a trail sign for Days Fork trail. The trail winds its way west and south after the sign as it climbs up Days Fork. <br><br>The trail to Green’s Basin breaks off .4 of a mile up the Day’s Fork trail. It branches sharply, almost back the way you have just come, on the left side of the trail. Use the GPS coordinate to find the exact spot to exit the trail as there are no definitive markers unless someone has broken trail before you. <br><br>Once off the main trail, the trail to Green’s Basin proceeds up the west face of the mountain through the aspen and conifers. Climb this west face. At .6 of a mile the trees open up and you get views down into Big Cottonwood Canyon and the road below. After the switchbacks up this west face the trail heads across the north face of the mountain rounding into Green’s Basin to the east. <br><br>The safest return trip is to head back the way you came.
